# CW-Assessment

## Overview
- On loading the page, User is presented with text introducing them to the page.
- Text prompts users to interact with three buttons below.
- On clicking one of the buttons, an API call is made depending on which button the user interacted with.
- A search bar is presented, which the user can enter in the name of the Star Wars character, planet, or movie they would like to see more information on. 
- If the target name or title matches what is in the stored data, then a modal will pop up, displaying some information about that particular item for the user.
- In addition to the search bar, there is also a table for the user to see a larger collection of data at once.
- Each table has the name or title of the target (be it a character, planet, or movie) that might be of interest, as well as several peices of data to compare. 
- Each spot on the table has a button (a red x) for the user to remove data they might want to omit. 
- There is also a way for the user to sort the table, by navigating to the ⚙️ symbol in the right hand corner of the table.
- The user will be able to sort the data properties in the table in ascending or descending order, such as alphabetical by name, chronological order the films take place in, planet populations, and more. 
- Planet and character datasets were incomplete. There may be entries with values listed as "unknown". The user can remove these one at a time, or can remove all of them at once by moving to the ⚙️ symbol and clicking ```Remove Unknowns```.
- Towards the bottom of the table, there are three buttons. These are to help the user navigate the tabular data.
- The user can move forward/backward one page at a time, or they may have all the data gathered displayed at once by clicking on the show all button.
